# EveryAuction154f
My own Version 154f of everyauction perl cgi

This is a project I altered for an auction website i made.
It is running here if you are curious:
http://pc.cybernexus.biz/auction/auction.pl

It is based on the original Every Auction version 153 - which may still be 
available here: 
http://www.everysoft.com/auction/
Rev. 09/30/13

My version adds buy now and buy out buttons, and the ability to register without 
a functioning email server.  It will require you opening the auction.pl file and
customising any options specific to your own needs such as categories and options.
